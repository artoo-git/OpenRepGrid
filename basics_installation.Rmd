### Installing R and RStudio

* The prerequisite for installing the `OpenRepGrid` package is that R has been installed on your computer. R can be downloaded from [here](http://cran.rstudio.com/) for Windows, MacOS or Linux. 

* **RStudio** is a program that makes it easier to handle R. You can download it from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

For both programs please follow the installation instructions on the websites.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("OpenRepGrid")
```

2. Make sure the following packages are installed. If not install them by typing
```{r eval=FALSE}

```
3. To download and install the OpenRepGrid development version from github you can use a function from the `devtools` package.

```
