### *Tools for the analysis of repertory grid data*

#### OpenRepGrid 

* The [*repertory grid*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid) (also *grid* or *repgrid*) is an interview method that originated from [Personal Construct Psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_construct_theory). It is applied in different academic and practical fields (clinical psychology, market research etc.). `OpenRepGrid` provides tools to analyze repertory grid data. It is a ‘plug-in’ for the statistical software [R](http://www.r-project.org/). Both are free and Open Source and will run on Windows, MacOS and Linux. 

#### Why an R package?

* [R](http://www.r-project.org/) is an Open Source framework for statistical programming. Its syntax is simple and it provides a wealth of functionality. This means that any ideas you might come up with can be implemented easily and be provided to other grid users around the world. That's why R is a strong basis to build `OpenRepGrid` upon. 

#### Join in!

* The OpenRepGrid project is supposed to be an endeavor of *collaborative construing*. Anyone who is interested in supporting the project is invited to [join in](participate.html). We hope that many participators will make `OpenRepGrid` a tool that really suits the needs of the community.


#### Future developments

* In a first phase `OpenRepGrid` will be a command line tool. In a second phase a graphical user interface (GUI) will be added. Features for administration of grids are currently not part of the project.
