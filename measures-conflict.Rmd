### Conflict measures bases on correlations

#### Description

The first approach to mathematically derive a conflict measure based on grid data was presented by [-@slade_measurement_1979]. They based their operationalization on an approach by @lauterbach_assessing_1975 who applied Heider's [-@heider_attitudes_1946] balance theory for a quantitative assessment of psychological conflict. The measure uses inter-construct correlation as a basis. It assess via the sign of the correlations of a triad of constructs if the constructs triad is balanced or imbalanced. A triad is imbalanced if one or three of the correlations are negative, i. e. when they leading to contrary implications [@slade_measurement_1979]. The function `indexConflict1` in `OpenRepGrid` calculates the proportion of conflictive triads in the grid as devised by Slade and Sheehan.

Slade and Sheehanâ€™s approach has several drawbacks, as it does not take into account the magnitude of the inter-construct correlations. As a consequence significant and insignificant correlations are not differentiated. Also, correlations of small magnitude, i.e. near zero, which may have a positive or negative signe due to chance alone distort the measure [@winter_construct_1982; @bassler_new_1992]. An improved version of the index that overcomes these shortcomings was proposed by [-@bassler_new_1992] and incorporated into the program *CT* (correlation test). The index enhances the identification of imbalanced triads by using a criterion that incorporates the magnitudes of correlations. From a psychological viewpoint, it remains unclear though what is measured. Connections to the concept of cognitive differentiation have been presumed [@krauthauser_new_1994]. The function `indexConflict2` in `OpenRepGrid` calculates the proportion of conflictive triads in the grid as devised by [-@bassler_new_1992].


#### Calculation 

##### @slade_measurement_1979 approach 

Multiply all correlations from a triad (formed by the constructs A, B and C) $r_{AB} r_{AC} r_{BC}$. If the sign of the result is negative, the triad is imbalanced. 

The table below shows when a triad made up of the constructs A, B, and C is balanced and imbalanced.
 
$r_{AB}$  | $r_{AC}$ | $r_{BC}$ | Triad characteristic
--------- | --------- | ---- | -----
+ | + | + | balanced
+ | + | - | imbalanced
+ | - | + | imbalanced
+ | - | - | balanced
- | + | + | imbalanced
- | + | - | balanced
- | - | + | balanced
- | - | - | imbalanced


##### @bassler_new_1992 approach 

Order correlations of the triad by absolute magnitude, so that $r_{max} > r_{mdn} > r_{min}$.

Apply Fisher's Z-transformation and devision by 3 to yield values between 1 and -1
Check whether the triad is balanced by assessing if the following relation holds:

* If $Z_{max} Z_{mdn} > 0$, the triad is balanced if $Z_{max} Z_{mdn} - Z_{min} <= crit$
* If $Z_{max} Z_{mdn} < 0$, the triad is balanced if $Z_{min} - Z_{max} Z_{mdn} <= crit$

#### R-Code

To use the Slade and Sheehan approach use

```{r}
indexConflict1(boeker)
```

For the Bassler et al. approach use

```{r}
indexConflict2(boeker)
indexConflict2(boeker, crit =.05)   # change critical value
```


### Conflict measures based on distances

#### Description

Measure of conflict or inconsistency as proposed by @bell_new_2004. The identification of conflict is based on distances rather than correlations as in other measures of conflict indexConflict1 and indexConflict2. It assesses if the distances between all components of a triad, made up of one element and two constructs, satisfies the "triangle inequality" [cf. @bell_new_2004]. If not, a triad is regarded as conflictive. An advantage of the measure is that it can be interpreted not only as a global measure for a grid but also on an element, construct, and element by construct level making it valuable for detailed feedback. Also, differences in conflict can be submitted to statistical testing procedures.

#### R-Code
