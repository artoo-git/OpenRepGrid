### Description

The Intensity index has been suggested by @bannister_conceptual_1960 as a measure of the amount of construct linkage. Bannister suggested that the score reflects the degree of organization of the construct system under investigation [@bannister_evaluation_1968]. The index resulted from his and his colleagues work on construction systems of patient suffering schizophrenic thought disorder. The concept of intensity has a theoretical connection to the notion of "tight" and "loose" construing as proposed by @kelly_psychology_1991. While tight constructs lead to unvarying prediction, loose constructs allow for varying predictions. Bannister hypothesized that schizophrenic thought disorder is liked to a process of extremely loose construing leading to a loss of predictive power of the subjectâ€™s construct system. The Intensity score as a structural measure is thought to reflect this type of system disintegration [@bannister_conceptual_1960].


### R-Code

The index can be prompted in `OpenRepGrid` as follows. It calculates an intensity score for each construct and each element, an average score for both types and an overall intensity value [cf. @feixas_gridcor:_2002].
