```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
options(width=120)
opts_chunk$set(comment=NA)
library(OpenRepGrid)
```

You can change several global settings for OpenRepGrid which will influence the way grids are displyed. You can promt the available settings by calling `settings()`.

```{r}
settings()
```

By default information about the scale and grid meta data is displayed.

```{r}
fbb2003
```

To change the settings enter the new parameters as `name=value` pairs. To turn off the display of the scale and meta information type in

```{r}
settings(show.scale=FALSE, show.meta=FALSE)
```

Now all grids are displayed without this information:

```{r}
fbb2003
```

Other settings that can be modified are maximal length of the construct that is displayed. Changing `show.cut`to `40` will prevent that the names of the constructs are cut off.

```{r}
settings(show.cut=40)
fbb2003
```

In order to not print the number of constructs and elements you can turn off this options by 

```{r}
settings(c.no=FALSE, e.no=FALSE)
fbb2003
```
